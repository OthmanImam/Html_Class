    <button name="#000"<h2>How to cook Curry Riceüçõ</h2>
    
    <h4><strong>INGREDIENTS</strong></h4>
       <p> uncooked rice (I used golden Sella basmati rice)
        
        Homemade or shop bought coconut milk
        
        Chicken stock
        
        Frozen mixed vegetables
        
        Mixed chillies sliced (substitute with red and green bell peppers) Liver, boiled, cubed and fried (this optional)

        Sweet corn
        
        Curry powder
        
        Thyme
        
        Parsley (optional)
        
        Vegetable oil (use less oil if you are you using chicken stock that already contains oil)
        
        Salt to taste Chicken bouillon powder (optional)

        Spring onions chopped
        
        Onion, sliced</p>
        <h3>HOW TO MAKE COCONUT FRIED RICE</h3>
        <p>Rinse the rice till water runs clean and set aside

            Place a pan on medium heat, add coconut milk, chicken stock and rinsed rice and mix to combine.  (Top up with water if need be, the liquid level should be about an inch higher than the rice) reduce the heat and bring the rice to boil for about 8-10 minutes.
            
            Add curry powder, thyme, parsley, chicken bouillon if using and salt to taste. Mix everything together till well combined.

            <p>Reduce the heat and cook rice until rice is fluffy, tender and light. Once the rice is cooked, add the chopped chillies to the rice and stir in to combine. Take the rice off the heat and set aside</p>

           <button name="#000"<p>Stir fry the veggies and liver

                Place a wok on medium-high heat, add 2tbsp vegetable oil and leave until hot, add mixed vegetables and chopped onions and stir fry till onions become translucent. This should be between 3-5 minutes.
                
                Add a pinch of curry, thyme and seasoning to the vegetables and stir together. followed by the fried livers and stir fry for another minute. Add sweet corn, stir together to combine and take it off the heat.</p>

                <p>Mix the rice into the vegetables

                    Place the cooked coconut rice back on medium heat, add the stir-fried vegetables and combine together. (You can use a wooden ladle for this job as it makes the job faster) at this stage of the cooking, you shouldn‚Äôt need to add water/stock to the rice. 
                    
                    The remaining steam in the rice will do the job. Take the rice off the heat and serve with some lovely protein of choice. I love mine with spicy baked chicken and some fried plantain.</p>
